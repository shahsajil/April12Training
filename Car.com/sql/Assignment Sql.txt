4. Get the number of records in the customer table for store id #1.
	
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CUSTOMER WHERE STORE_ID = '1';

5. Get all payment records for customer with email address "NANCY.THOMAS@sakilacustomer.org"
	
	SELECT CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME, CUSTOMER.EMAIL, PAYMENT.AMOUNT, PAYMENT.PAYMENT_DATE, PAYMENT.LAST_UPDATE

6. Use a View to get the film info for actor Bob Fawcett.

7. Use a Stored Procedure to get the 4 inventory ids for the film "Alien Center" at Store #2.

From inventory
Inner Join film
on inventory.film_id = film.film_id
where title = "Alien Center" And store_id = 2;


8. Insert a new store. Ensure that you use TRANSACTION. (This one is possible but it's tough! Pay attention to constraints and the order that you are inserting data.)
